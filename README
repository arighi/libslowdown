libslowdown
===========

A very simple libc wrapper to slow down open() syscalls.

This can be used to slow down the meta-data operations performed over network
attached devices or filesystems (iSCSI, NFS, etc.) and reduce the load
generated by meta-data intensive background workloads (i.e., nightly backups).

Example usage
=============

 $ make
 $ export SLOWDONW_PREFIX=/backup
 $ export SLOWDOWN_MS=25
 $ export LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/libslowdown.so.0.1

At this point any open() called by all programs executed from this shell
session will be forced to sleep for 25ms if the target file is under /backup
(subdirs included).
